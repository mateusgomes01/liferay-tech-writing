# Users and Organizations

Users and Organizations are basic blocks included in any Liferay Portal site. Users are required for site management through user accounts. Organizations are used to divide users hierarchically into departments.

Users and Organizations are managed in the Control Panel, under the _Users and Organizations_ section. Some of the management options are:

* Creation of new users.
* Deactivation and deletion of users.
* Changing users privilege.
* Organize users by department.
* Create new internal websites for departments.
* Edit Users.

## Users definition
